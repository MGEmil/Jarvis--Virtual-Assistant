A virtual assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual. The term ”chatbot” is also used to refer to virtual assistants. Remember the time, when you were watching Iron Man and wondered to yourself, how cool it would be if you had your own J.A.R.V.I.S? Well, It's time to make that dream into a reality.

Artificial intelligence is the next gen. Imagine how cool it would be if you had your friends over at your house, and all of a sudden you go, "Hey JARVIS, show me some memes.", and JARVIS goes "Sure, sir. Here are the latest Italian memes.", whilst showing you the funniest Italian memes. Cool right?

Virtual assistants use Artificial Intelligence to match user text input to executable commands. It can provide a wide variety of services, These includes:
 - Search anything on Google
